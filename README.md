# PDF Form Filler (Hackathon)

  

## Why

We are trying to automate some of our daily tasks. One of them is filling out immigration PDF forms. We need to be able to fill out a specific PDF form using data from our database.

  

## What

We would like to be able to fill out a PDF form automatically and generate a new version with all its fields filled out.

  

## Recommendations:

-   You can use any programming language to accomplish this task;
    
-   Youâ€™re free to use any 3rd party API/library, but you must include all detailed info about it;
    
-   You must include detailed information about how to run your project.
    

  

## Output:

-   The same PDF with some data filled in
